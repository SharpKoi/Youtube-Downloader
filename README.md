# Simple Youtube Downloader
Just write a simple tool for myself and provide it to those who needs.

## Environment
[![Python 3.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
You should download python in your computer.

## Usage
(For Windows7/8/10) Just download the repo into your music folder, and run the commands in `cmd`
```shell
cd D:\example\
D:
python test.py
```

## Notice
I have no idea how to save memory when downloading videos with high quality.  
  
So if you tried to deploy the codes and use it to download video with high qulity in cloud server that only has less than 1G memory, you may get an memory error.
